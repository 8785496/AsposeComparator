## Approaches
* used dependency injections to improve the code structure and increase unit testability
* used an input data validation on the server and client-side
* used notifications about errors in UI
* used a color distance to compare colors

## Installation requirements
* .net core 3.1
* msbuilder

## Improvements
* change recursion to loop
* add weight coefficients to the color comparison algorithm
